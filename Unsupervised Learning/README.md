# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
In this project we are going to implement the following Unsupervised Learning Algorithm
* K-means Clustering with PCA
