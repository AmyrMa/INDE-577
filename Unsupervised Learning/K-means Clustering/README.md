# K-means Clustering and PCA
## Principal component analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. 
### Procedure for PCA
steps for the PCA are as follows:
1. Center and scale the data
2. Compute the covariance or correlation matrix
3. Find the eigenvalues and the orthonormal eigenvectors of S.
4. Find the principal components.
5. Reduce the dimension of the data.
Here we use the PCA built in function from the package to complete our task
