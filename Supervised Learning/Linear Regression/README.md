# Implementation of Linear Regression Model
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. Regression models a target prediction values based on independent varaibles. It is mostly used for finding out the realationship between variables and forecasting.

The linear model has the following equation:\
$Y =\beta X+\epsilon$
Where $\beta$ is the coefficient terms and X is our design matrix, also is the matrix of our independent varaibles. and $\epsilon$ is our model error. 

## Cost function
the different values for coefficients will produce different line of regression. the cost function is used to estimate the values of the coefficient for the best fit line.

## Important assumtions of Linear Regression
* Linear relationship between the features and target
* Small or no multicollinearity between the features
* Homoscedasticity Assumption
* Normal distribution of error terms
* No autocorrelations
