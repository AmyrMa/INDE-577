# Neural Network
A Perceptron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data. From previous perceptron model, we see that perceptron is very powerful. Neural network is basically multiple perceptron working together as shown below:

## Data 
In this example we will apply neural network on the MNIST-fashing dataset.This data set contains 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
