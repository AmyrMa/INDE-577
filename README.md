# Data Science and Machine Learning
In this project, I am going to implement all algorithms covered in class and test it on the dataset I found online
the following algorithm will be covered in the project. 
#### Supervised Learning: 
* Model Building and Error Analysis
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision/ Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning:
